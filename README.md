## Three by Example

This repo is a collection of excercises to improve my understanding of the Three.js library and OOP in Javascript by recreating a selection of examples from the website and Three.js Cook Book using ES6 Classes.

### Rules:
* Keep functionality and aesthetics identical to avoid getting distracted by scope creep but write any ideas I have down for future sketches
* Use React as a cointainer/UI layer and experiment with different ways of managing state/events between React & Three.js to formulate best practices
* Use declarative code over imperative when practical
* Create re-usable modules for common functionality I discover between examples
* Practice adhering to S.O.L.I.D principles
* No copy/pasting code except for Shaders.
